Weathere is a simple and responsive web-based weather application that allows users to check the current weather for any location. The app fetches data from a weather API, displays key weather details, and ensures a smooth user experience with a clean, modern UI
This project consists of three main files:
index.html - The HTML structure of the application.
index.js - The JavaScript code responsible for fetching and handling weather data.
style.css - The styling of the weather application to ensure it's visually appealing and responsive.
